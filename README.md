# BlitsPerSecond

**BlitsPerSecond** is a Python game engine that seeks to simulate the experience of developing for 16-bit consoles and home computers of the late 80s and early 90s, like the Amiga, SNES, and Sega Genesis. It focuses on providing a performant, constraint-driven environment that imposes restrictions by design to encourage retro-style game development. The engine is ideal for people new to programming or those that want to lean into the old 8-bit and 16-bit era.
